# tic-tac-toe
See if I can build my own tic-tac-toe gave with vanilla javaScript

# Version 0:
Files setup but blank

# Version 1:
- Build the table
- Done

# Version 2:
- ID which box is clicked
- Done

# Version 3:
- Place the proper char into the proper box
- Done

# Version 4:
- Limit play to 9 plays
- Done, but that does not bar changing an X to an O if the number of plays is
-   less than 10

# Version 5:
- Work on restricting each cell to being changed only once per game
- Went back to Version 3
- Done.
-   Cells are only updated once per click, but clicking on a cell a second time
-   still increments i which can cause an O to be displayed instead of an X the
-   next time a blank cell is clicked

# Version 6
- Update i only when a cell is updated
- Done. And it seemed pretty easy. Does not seem to have caused any issues.

# Version 7
- Check for a winner and console.log() it
- Done.

# Version 8
- Output result to the DOM
- Done.

# Version 9
- Add a reset button that shows up when a result is achieved
- Done.

# Version 10
- Have the reset button actually work

# Version 11
- Have the result and reset button removed from the DOM once the reset button
-   is clicked.
